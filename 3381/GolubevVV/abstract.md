Software and hardware diagnostics is important. Being detailed and vivid
it can save a significant amount of programmers debug hours. ROS
ecosystem provides a number of advanced tools for analyzing environment
and individual node state (e.g. *ros\_runtime\_monitor*, *rqt\_console*,
*rosbag*, etc.). But it still lacks a standard system and process
diagnostics tool. This paper attempts to present a reusable solution to
fill this gap and highlight the benefits of such tool for ROS community.
